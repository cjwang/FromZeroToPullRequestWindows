How to submit code to a GitHub project on Windows
=================================================

*From Zero to “Pull Request”*

This guide is intended for developers on the Windows platform who have not
previously used Git or GitHub, but who do have basic knowledge of at least one
other source control system.  This guide is different from other guides because:

-   *It is specifically for developers who use Windows*

-   It tells you what to do step-by-step; most other Git guidance is entirely
    open-ended

The reader is strongly encouraged to learn more about Git and GitHub from any of
the many other wonderful guides out there after having successfully navigated
this guide.  **This guide is only intended to get you started!**

Note that this guide assumes that:

-   You are using Windows 7 or higher

-   You have administrative rights on your machine

-   You have some sort of text editor available (Notepad is fine).

Installing Stuff and Registering
--------------------------------

Go to <https://windows.github.com> and download the “GitHub for Windows” client.
Install it.  This gives you a Windows UI suitable for most Git operations and a
PowerShell-based Git environment.

Once the installation is complete, you will have to log in to GitHub.
Registering and contributing to open source projects on GitHub is free.

-   Click the "Sign up" link in the GitHub for Windows application and then
    follow the directions to sign up for a free account via the web site.

-   Note that your GitHub username is always public, but *your email address can
    public or private* depending on how you set the options (see below).
